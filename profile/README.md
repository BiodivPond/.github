# BiodivPond
BiodivPond is a pilot monitoring initiative supported by Biodiversa+ for the period 2026 to 2028. The full title is "Biodiversity monitoring of ponds: evaluating the applicability of novel methods and identification of obstacles to wide use".

The objectives of the BiodivPond pilot are:
1) **Establish a transnational pond monitoring network across Europe:** Each active
contributor will sample a minimum of 6 ponds (80 in total) during late spring of 2026 for
biodiversity and key local environmental pond conditions following a highly
standardised sampling protocol based on traditional methods, eDNA and PAM,
targeting amphibians, fish, aquatic macro-invertebrates, and bats.
3) **Design and pilot a citizen science-based biodiversity monitoring scheme for
ponds across Europe:** All active contributors will collaborate in the development and
implementation of a participatory citizen science-based monitoring scheme focusing on
amphibians, fish and aquatic macro-invertebrates. The monitoring will follow a
standardised field protocol to assess key local environmental pond conditions and to
collect samples for the analysis of eDNA. A total of 500 additional ponds are located in
different biogeographical regions throughout Europe.
5) **Deliver a shared open-access data infrastructure:** A publicly accessible digital
repository hosting all genomic (eDNA) and acoustic (PAM) data, including relevant
metadata and species occurrence information, is operational by the project’s end,
facilitating transparency and reproducibility.
4) **Operationalise data integration workflows:** A tested and transferable pipeline
enabling the integration of eDNA and PAM data into national and international
biodiversity databases, and Europe-wide frameworks is in place and usable by all
project partners.

6) **Provide user-friendly biodiversity visualisation tools:** Interactive tools and
dashboards displaying species presence and geographical distributions have been
developed and made available to stakeholders, including nature managers, policymakers,
and the public.
